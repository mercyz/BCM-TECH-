PHP
1 = The H1 Tag in the PHPTEST document file does not have any closing tag which will resolve to an error (break) in the program.
2 =  The variable $pages is not defined but decleared 
3 = The while loop is not closed this will result to an error because a closing currly braces "}" is missing 
4:  $content = get_the_content() will be ignorned as "$content" is been reassigned with another value  ($content = preg_replace_callback('#[ad]#')
5 = The Regex '#[ad]#' will first replace 'a' with a div and then 'd' with a new div leaving the bracket 
6 = Functions are expected to return values and not echo them.

WORDPRESS

HTML
1 = The Abbrevation tag attribute name="lobortis" is supposed to be title="lobortis"
2 = The Image tag attribute with spelling is wrong.. correct attribute should be "width"
3 = The closing tag for "</code>" is suppose to come after the closing tag </b>
4 = spaces between closing tag is not supported </a  > this is wrong. 
5  = Quotation marks are encouraged when adding attributes. example <img width="100" /> this is encouraged for the sake of compactability with older browsers version
